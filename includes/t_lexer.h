**	state_list is a list which has ssize_t* as data. Each of these 3 int holds
**	data about the state of the current operation: data[_T_STATE] -> current
**	state of the automaton data[_T_START] -> where the current operation
**	STARTED (index of the first character to include IN the token) data[_T_END]
**	-> where the operation ended (index of the last character to include IN the
**	token) Its a stack of ssize_t
**
**	state is a pointer to a node of state_list, representing its current state
**
**	line is the adress of a string. This string is malloc'ed by init_lexer(),
**	and must be freed at some point.
**
**	pos is our main offset, used to read the line char by char.
**
**	cmd_name_open is a flag, set to TRUE (1) if the next word we see can
**	potentially be a command name, or FALSE (0) if it is not possible
**	(obviously because we have already found one in the current command)
